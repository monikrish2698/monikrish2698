### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Monish Krishnan (MonK) this side! Analysing data is like a treasure hunt. You experience valuable outcomes only when you do it right. In last three years as an analyst and then an academic researcher I have worked with diverse datasets from user-website interaction to [Ratemyprofessor]([url](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)) data. I have scraped, analysed, visualised and modelled data using different techniques. The one common outcome from all these experiences - is "**right exploration** leads to the **right direction**." 

I am currently pursuing my post-graduate in AI/ML from Plaksha University, enhancing my data and people skills.
